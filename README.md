# timebank
The TimeBank website is coded from a prototype which I made by Adobe XD.
The design solution for the TimeBank is that people can exchange their time and experitse from other's time and expertise.
The home page of the TimeBank is for a user, and the user can see his/her time balance, total time earned, total time spent.
Also, the user can see the latest trades and upcoming appointments on the home page.
After the latest trades and upcoming appointments section, there are two sections that users can search for service, requeste for help, find a service or request, and list a service.
The design of TimeBank website is colourful and simple, so every user uses it can enjoy the website. 
Also, the website is applied accessbility and responsive design on it.
